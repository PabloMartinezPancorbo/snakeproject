**Snake Game with `pygame`**

This project is an enhanced version of the classic Snake Game built using Python 3.13 and the Pygame library. It features interactive gameplay and tracks the highest scores achieved by players. Players can input their names directly on the game screen after each session, and the game records and displays the top 5 highest scores.

**Features**:
- Classic Snake Gameplay: Navigate the snake to collect food, growing longer with each piece consumed.
- High Score Tracking: Stores the top 5 scores, including player names, in a persistent JSON file.
- On-Screen Name Input: Players can input their names directly on the game screen after the game ends.
- Replay or Exit Option: Players can choose to play again by pressing Enter or exit by pressing ESC. The game automatically closes after 10 seconds of inactivity.
- User-Friendly Display: Shows the current score, the highest score during gameplay, and the top 5 scores on the game over screen.

**Technology Stack**:
- Python 3.13
- Pygame Library
- JSON for Data Storage

**Usage**:
- Controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- Game Over: Input your name when prompted after losing, and see your score ranked on the top 5 list.
- Replay or Exit: Press Enter to play again or ESC to exit. The game automatically closes after 10 seconds if no input is detected.
